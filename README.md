about quicksort-visualization:
This package is out of the experiments because it is used to draw perturbation envelop of quicksort algorithm.

## Perturbations

In order to explore it, we use 5 explorations:

   * Add 1 at each call of each perturbation Point.
   * Add N, an increasing magnitude at each call of each perturbation points.
   * Add 1 with an increasing random probability.
   * Negation of Boolean at each call of each perturbation Point.
   * Negation of Boolean with an increasing random probability.
   * Minus 1 at each call of each perturbation Point.

## Run

Run the systematical call exploration with plus one perturbator model on quicksort, with 20 array of 100 integers with verbose mode:

```
git clone 
https://github.com/Spirals-Team/correctness-attraction-experiments.git
cd correctness-attraction-experiments
./src/script/light-install.sh

mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="experiment.Main" -Dexec.args="-v -s qs -nb 20 -size 100 -exp call one"
```

Run the task size exploration on md5:

```
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="experiment.Main" -Dexec.args="-s md5 -run tasksize"
```

## GUI

Run the gui on zip:

```
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="experiment.Main" -Dexec.args="-s zip -run gui"
```


## Advanced usage

In order to install all projects, launch the following script, it will install everything you will need to run experiments but it will take a while and need at least gradle version 2.13 installed and in your path.

```
./src/script/install.sh
```


```
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="experiment.Main" -Dexec.args="<options>"
```


Options available :
* -size \<integer> specify the size of each task
* -nb \<integer> specify the number of task
* -time \<integer> specify the number of seconds to wait until timeout
* -v or -verbose to active Runner verbose mode
* -s \<subject> to specify the subject
* value for \<subject> : qs zip rc4 laguerre tea torrent rsa sudoku bayes simplex mt md5 bc
* -exp \<exp> specify the exp
* value for \<exp> call rnd heatmap
* for call and rnd exp you have to specify which \<exploration> just after it.
* value for \<exploration> : pone mone magnitude boolean
* you can specify an array of magnitude to be used just after the key-word magnitude
* a list of integer separated with ":" (1:2:3 for example)
* after the exploration, you can specify the random rates list used by rnd explorer just as for the magnitude (but with float)
* -run tasksize tasknumber to run the exploration of the impact of the size or the number of task
* runs will be executed before everything else, you must specify a subject (with -s) before
* you can type -run gui to run the demo gui with success meter
* -help display this help
