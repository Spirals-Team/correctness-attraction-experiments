# jPerturb-experiments

This project contains experiments for jPerturb

* sort : Perturbation on Quicksort.
* zip : Perturbation on LZW compression.
* md5 : Perturbation on MD5 hash function.
* sudoku : Perturbation on a Sudoku solver.

## Experiments

The experiments are the exploration of the perturbation envelop of each project.

In order to explore it, we use 3 campaigns :

   * Add 1 at each call of each perturbation Point.
   * Add N, an incresing magnitude at each call of each perturbation points.
   * Add 1 with a increasing random probability.
