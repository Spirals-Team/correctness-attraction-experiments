# jPerturb-experiments

This project contains experiments for [jPerturb](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/jPerturb)

* quicksort : Perturbation on Quicksort.
* zip : Perturbation on LZW compression.
* md5 : Perturbation on MD5 hash function.
* sudoku : Perturbation on a Sudoku solver.
* optimizer : Solver of linear program with the Simplex algorithm from [math3](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/) of Apache lib.
* mersenne : an implementation of the Mersenne-Twister PRNG : [link](http://www.java2s.com/Code/Java/Development-Class/MersenneTwisterRandom.htm)
* torrent : implementation of bittorent protocol retrieve [here](https://github.com/mpetazzoni/ttorrent).
* bitcoin : implementation of bitcoin node in java found [here](https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj).
* classifier : a Naive bayes classifier from [Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/).

If the source is not specified, sources come from [RosettaCode](http://rosettacode.org/)

about quicksort-visualization :
This package is out of the experiments because it is used to draw perturbation envelop of quicksort algorithm.

## Experiments

The experiments are the exploration of the perturbation envelop of each project.

In order to explore it, we use 5 campaigns :

   * Add 1 at each call of each perturbation Point.
   * Add N, an increasing magnitude at each call of each perturbation points.
   * Add 1 with an increasing random probability.
   * Negation of Boolean at each call of each perturbation Point.
   * Negation of Boolean with an increasing random probability.

## Install & Running

In order to install, just launch the following script :

```
./src/script/install.sh
```

It will install everything you will need to run experiments (nearly 7 minutes).

In order to try, run :

```
java -cp target/classes quicksort.Main -v
```

It about 5 minutes to execute and run all campaigns on the quicksort subject, with 20 arrays of 100 integers.

## Options

You can run each subject separately, or all of it with the Runner. Options remains the same.

Several options are available :
* -size <integer> specify the size of each task
* -nb <integer> specify the number of task
* -time <integer> specify the number of seconds to wait until timeout
* -v or -verbose to active Runner verbose mode
* -exp <exp> specify the exp. If no exp is specified, the program will run all of it. values available for <exp> are : addOne addN BoolCall IntRnd BoolRnd

## Running commands

You can run "little" exp (quicksort,zip,md5,sudoku and mersenne) as you ran quicksort :

```
java -cp target/classes <package_exp>.Main <list of options>
```

For the "large" exp (optimizer, torrent, bitcoin, classifier and cipher (comming soon)), you must run them with all dependencies. The easiest way to do so is to use the maven command exec :

```
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="<package_exp>.Main" -Dexec.args="<list of options"
```

or you can try to add dependencies manually.
