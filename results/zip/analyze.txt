Location 0 and 15 :
    int dictSize = PerturbationEngine.pint(__L0, 256);
    int dictSize = PerturbationEngine.pint(__L15, 256);
This size a no impact on the algorithm. It has to be at least as long as there is different token in the string we want to compress

Location 2(17) and 3(18)

for (int i =  0 ; (PerturbationEngine.pint(__L2, i)) < (PerturbationEngine.pint(__L3, 256)) ; i++)
            dictionary.put(i, ("" + ((char) (i))));

The location 2 skip the last iteration : the char 256 : Ā is not added by default to the dictionary. In the case there is this character in the sequence that we want to compress, the algorithm throw an exception :

We can put an extra char in the dictionnary with the location 3.

Location 4 :

for (int i = 0; i < PerturbationEngine.pboolean(__L4, 256) ; i++)
    dictionary.put(i, ("" + ((char) (i))));

This locations breaks the for loop. Then the initial dictionary of the decompress function is small and not match with the compress one. This
 results with a wrong string.
