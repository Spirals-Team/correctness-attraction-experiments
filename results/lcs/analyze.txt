Location 0 to 5
    int[][] lengths = new int[a.length()+1][b.length()+1];

These locations add one column/row to the array of computing the lengths. This results in extra iteration but doesn't change the final output.

Location 52 :
    for (int x = a.length(), y = b.length(); x != 0 && y != 0; )  { ... }

Introduce an extra loop iteration, but can't produce ArrayOutBoundException. There is an impact only at the last iteration, i.e. when y == 0, but under conditions:
       x != 0, so y == 0.
