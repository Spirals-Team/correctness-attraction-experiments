Location 0 to 5
    int[][] lengths = new int[a.length()+1][b.length()+1];

These locations add one column/row to the array of computing the lengths. This results in extra iteration but doesn't change the final output.

Location 52 :
    for (int x = a.length(), y = b.length(); x != 0 && y != 0; )  { ... }

Introduce an extra loop iteration, but can't produce ArrayOutBoundException. There is an impact only at the last iteration, i.e. when y == 0, but under conditions:
       x != 0, so y == 0.

for (int i = 0; i < a.length(); i++)
    for (int j = 0; PerturbationEngine.pboolean(__L14, j < b.length()); j++)
        if (a.charAt(i) == b.charAt(j))
            lengths[i+1][j+1] = lengths[i][j] + 1;
        else
            lengths[i+1][j+1] = Math.max(lengths[i+1][j], lengths[i][j+1]);

Location 14
    This location is really interesting because it introduce a kind of "k-band" for the array
    of the length computed.
    The fact is, if the loop is broken at the end of the loop when x is close to zero (begin of the top loop), this creates the top
    of the k-band. In the other hand, when x is close to the a.length and the loop is broken at the begin, this create the bottom of the k-band.
    However, this half k-band is correctly created in 75% + of the run.
