Location 3 :


if (y.getColumnDimension() > 1) {throw new ...}
                             ^ l3
this location has no impact on the computation because y > 2 has the same value thant y > 1 in our case.

Location 73.

Matrix x = new Matrix(a.getColumnDimension(), 1);
                                              ^
This points add a row to the matrix x. This has no impact because every later access is done by the literal 0. the extra Row is never Read/Write.
