Location 3 :


if (y.getColumnDimension() > 1) {throw new ...}
                             ^ l3
this location has no impact on the computation because y > 2 has the same value thant y > 1 in our case.

Location 73.

Matrix x = new Matrix(a.getColumnDimension(), 1);
                                              ^
This points add a row to the matrix x. This has no impact because every later access is done by the literal 0. the extra Row is never Read/Write.

do {
    // Set ridge regression adjustment
    Matrix ssWithRidge = ss.copy();
    for (int i = 0; i < nc; i++)
        ssWithRidge.set(i, i, ssWithRidge.get(i, i) + ridge);

    }
} while (!PerturbationEngine.pboolean(__L9, (!(PerturbationEngine.pboolean(LinearRegression.__L8, success)))));

Location 27 :

success = PerturbationEngine.pboolean(LinearRegression.__L27, true);

This point induce one more iteration of the loops.
